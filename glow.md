# Smart Thermostat Project: GLOW

Webiste: 

## Context
This innitiative was part of the 2nd Year project at Imperial College (IC). The idea of working on a smart thermostat prototype was submitted by two other students and myself. Another 4 students also joined the team, attracted by the project idea. My motivation to work on such product came from observing common household thermostats unable to cope with the important transformations affecting global and local energy production, distribution and consumption. Other products have and are currently being worked on by a few companies, but the idea for us was to offer a unique personalised experience to to the user, relying on social and economic principles to save energy. 

Dr. Jeremy Pitt, Deputy Head of the Intelligent Systems and Networks Group at IC and active researcher in Smart Meter technology, chose to support us throughout this project, regularily offering technical and methodical advice during meetings with the team. 

## Personal Implication
My job was mainly based on coordinating work being done by team members and lead meetings and discussions. This included project planning, work distribution based on skills and motivation of team members, setting objectives and deadlines to the team, with the team.
On the technocal side of things, I was involved in building the website for GLOW. The website not only aims at describing our product in an accessible way, it also plays a role it the operation of the thermostat as each registered user enters details about household and energy tariff onto the webiste. This lead me to work extensively with HTML, CSS, php and SQL.

## Technology
The project also involved work in: 
- Software development: two student worked on the Python GUI and backend programming. 
- Hardware integration: simple use of a raspberry pi here, alongside a touchscreen for intuitive user interface. A temperature sensor was also added. Two students have been working on this aspect.
- Social science research: one student was in charge of gathering all relevant information on how to effectively impact public opinion and push them to save energy. This information was then mapped to real features that the thermostat would offer to the user.
- Thermal science research: one funcitonality, aiming at monitoring and predicting cash spending of the user based on his heating/cooling programm, required some thermal research to take all kinds of energy losses into account. One student was in charge of the task.
- 3D printed enclosure: The electronics were utlimately enclosed in a custom 3D printed case to reach the MVP we had imagined on day 1.
