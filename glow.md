# Smart Thermostat Project: GLOW

## Context
This innitiative is part of the 2nd Year project at Imperial College. The idea of working on a smart thermostat prototype was submitted by two other students and myself. Another 4 students also joined the team, attracted by the project idea. My decision choosing to work on such product came from dealing with thermostats at home unable to cope with the deep transformation energy production, distribution and consumption are undergoing. Other products have and are currently being worked on by a few companies, but the idea was to offer a unique personalised experience to to the user, relying on social and economic principles to save energy.
