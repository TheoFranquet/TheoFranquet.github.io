## EEbug project

My first year project at Imperial College aimed at introducing me to basic breadboard circuitry design, sensor integration and general project management. The project, tackled by teams of 6, consisted of designing and building a "small electric car" prototype able to follow any black line drawn on a surface. After reaching the end of the line, the robot had to be able to do an inward spiral before ultimately stopping. The team was handed out a budget and basic passive circuitry components alongside a set of restrictions for the design.
