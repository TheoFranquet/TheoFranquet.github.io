I am currently an Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) undergraduate student in Imperial College London, with big amitions to work on challenging and meaningful projects through various applications in my field. I invite you to explore the rest of this page to learn more about some of my works in the past few years and read on my technical educational background.


### :electric_plug: Hardware
- VHDL programming: 

### :computer: Firmware & Software
- Real time digital signal processing: Speech enhancement project

### :mag: Research
I have undergone undergraduate research in the summer of 2016 at Imperial College London's Control and Power research group on future horizon velocity estimation using artifical neural networks:

- Comparative study of various training methods for the application
- Continuous time operation simulation of the ANN onboard a vehicle

Repo is available here.

### :briefcase: Work Experience
#### Semiconductors Industry
I have worked 3 months at ST Microelectronics Singapore over the summer of 2015, my work there involved:

1. Manufacturing of Bipolar Devices 
2. Manual device failure analysis
3. Training material establishement

#### Renewables & Energy Storage Industry
My industrial placement, undergone in conjunction with Imperial College London, is spent working for 6 months at Natron Energy (formerly Alveo Energy), in Santa Clara, CA. Natron Energy is a battery start up introducing revolutionary low cost energy storage solutions using a new cell technology based on inexpensive Prussian blue analogue electrodes and a sodium-ion electrolyte. My work here includes:

1. Integral Battery Management System (BMS) development for UPS application
2. PCB design
3. Firmware development for power critical application
4. Battery state estimation algorithm R&D
