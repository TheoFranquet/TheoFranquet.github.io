I am currently an Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) undergraduate student at Imperial College London, with big ambitions to work on challenging and meaningful projects through various applications in my field. I invite you to explore the rest of this page to learn more about some of my works in the past few years and read on my technical educational background.

## :mag: Research
I have undergone undergraduate research in the summer of 2016 at Imperial College London's Control and Power research group on future horizon vehicle velocity estimation using artificial neural networks [[Project Description](/UROP.md)]: 

- Comparative study of various training methods for the application [[Paper](/Report_v2.pdf)]
- Continuous time operation simulation of the ANN onboard a vehicle [[Paper](/untitled-23.pdf)]

Repo is available [here](https://github.com/TheoFranquet/UROP).

My final year thesis delves into the integration of large-scale energy storage systems into modern energy market structures. More specifically, the paper proposes an optimal bidding strategy model for battery storage with the consideration of life-time degradation [[Paper](/Report_v2.pdf)]

The project was supervised by Dr Fei Teng, EEE Department, Imperial College London.

## :briefcase: Work Experience
### Semiconductors Industry

 <img src="stlogo.jpg" height="55" width="90">  

I have worked for 3 months for *ST Microelectronics Singapore* over the summer of 2015, my work there involved:

- Manufacturing Engineering for Bipolar Devices 
- Manual device failure analysis
- Training material redacting

### Renewables & Energy Storage Industry

 <img src="natron.jpg" height="90" width="90">  

My industrial placement, undergone in liaison with Imperial College London, was spent working for 6 months at *Natron Energy* (formerly Alveo Energy), in Santa Clara, CA. Natron Energy is a battery start up introducing revolutionary low cost energy storage solutions using a new cell technology based on inexpensive Prussian blue analogue electrodes and a sodium-ion electrolyte. My work here includes:

- Integral Battery Management System (BMS) development for UPS application
- Altium PCB design & debugging
- Firmware development & debugging for power critical application
- Battery state estimation algorithm R&D
- SPI communication development
- Test automation
 
## :memo: Personal Writing  
A mix of curiosity and ambition towards the transition to sustainable energy production and management in todayâ€™s society has led me to start writing a collection of 3 short articles on the topic of renewable energy integration and dynamics in the non-scientific world. A lot of technological ground has been covered in the sector of fossil fuel alternatives. However, it is only now that those technologies are starting to attract major interest of governments, research groups and financial investments thanks to an increasing combination of mainstream environmental concern, technology affordability and scientific advances. These three articles will give an insight on the political, mediatic and financial facets of the matter.
