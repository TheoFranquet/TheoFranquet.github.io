[Curriculum Vitae](/CV.pdf) & [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theo-franquet-1b7097b3)


I am currently an Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) undergraduate student at Imperial College London, with big amitions to work on challenging and meaningful projects through various applications in my field. I invite you to explore the rest of this page to learn more about some of my works in the past few years and read on my technical educational background.
My focus at this stage is aimed at embedded system design, power applications and machine learning.

My main objectve as an engineer is to participate in improving quality of life for the people in need, while ensuring a viable future for the generations to come. I mean it!

### :briefcase: Work Experience
#### Semiconductors Industry
I have worked 3 months at ST Microelectronics Singapore over the summer of 2015, my work there involved:

1. Manufacturing of Bipolar Devices 
2. Manual device failure analysis
3. Training material creation

#### Renewables & Energy Storage Industry
My industrial placement, undergone in liaison with Imperial College London, is spent working for 6 months at Natron Energy (formerly Alveo Energy), in Santa Clara, CA. Natron Energy is a battery start up introducing revolutionary low cost energy storage solutions using a new cell technology based on inexpensive Prussian blue analogue electrodes and a sodium-ion electrolyte. My work here includes:

1. Integral Battery Management System (BMS) development for UPS application
2. PCB design
3. Firmware development for power critical application
4. Battery state estimation algorithm R&D
5. SPI communication development
 
### :memo: Personal Writing  
A mix of curiosity and ambition towards the transition to sustainable energy production and management in todayâ€™s society has led me to start writing a collection of 3 short articles on the topic of renewable energy integration and dynamics in the non-scientific world. A lot of technological ground has been covered in the sector of fossil fuel alternatives. However, it is only now that those technologies are starting to attract major interest of governments, research groups and financial investments thanks to an increasing combination of mainstream environmental concern, technology affordability and scientific advances. These three articles will give an insight on the political, mediatic and financial facets of the matter.

- The role of media in public environmental awareness [Under Construction]
- Environmental effort and economic prosperity [Under Construction]
