## Real Time Speech Enhacement Project

This project aimed at implementing real time digital signal processing routines and algorithms for audio processing. The program is able to take a noisy audio recording as an input while instantly outputing the same recording damping the surrounding noise to isolate human voice recording. This technology is already being used in everyday telephone communications.

Several filtering and transformation techniques have been implemented and tested to try and achieve high overall performance. 
A more complete explanation of the project, alongside the complete C code file is available in the report uploaded on my [RTDSP github repo](https://github.com/TheoFranquet/RTDSP).
